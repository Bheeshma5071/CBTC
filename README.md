Projects for CipherByte Technologies Internship Programme.
There are two projects in this repository.
First projects is a number guessing game. In the game the computer generates a random number in between 0 and 100 and the user has to guess the number in 10 attempts. If the user fails to guess the number withing the given number of attempts the they lose the game. The system will inform whether the number guessed by the user if smaller or greater than the system generated number. Maximum points that can be achieved is 10 i.e. if the user guessed the right number in the first attempt itself. One point will be deducted for every wrong guess.
You can view the code from NumberGuessGame.java.
Hope you enjoy your time here.
My second project, banking_system is a demonstration of ATM system where you have to first create 10 accounts with customer name, account number and bank balance. You can select a customer from the 10 accounts created and perform operations like withdrawing or depositing money or balance enquiry ar you can just simply leave the interface.

Thank You.
